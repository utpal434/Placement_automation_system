# Placement_automation_system
This Placement Automation System project aims to build a Placement Automation System that will facilitate the interaction between college students and the placement cell of the college.The system will maintain student information such as grades, courses taken,resume etc .  All this student information will be uploaded by the student and will be made public after verification by the placement cell. The system will be updated by recruiting drive by the placement cell. Students could check information regarding the job, payment and selection criteria. A schedule for the recruiting drive will also be posted. Students who meet the criteria will be able to apply and will then be notified at each stage of the recruitment.
